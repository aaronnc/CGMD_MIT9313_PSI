Notes :

LMG, LHG, DGD, and SQD are aliases for OPMG, OPPG, OPGG, and OPSG  respectively. 
They are used for the assignment of internal lipids from the cryo-EM structure of PSI (PDB:5OY0). 
p_cg_[up]x[ro]n_final.itp correspond to templated instances of Fd and Pc ( u|p = Fd|Pc , r|o = reduced|oxidized )
